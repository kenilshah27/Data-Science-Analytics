IPL is a cricketing event which takes place one a year in India. More then being just a sport it has become a big festival in India,
where for around 2 months people spend their time following their favorite franchise and supporting their favourite player. Coming from 
India and being a big Cricket fan myself, i decided to do analysis of how the tournament has been since its inaugural in 2007.

I have taken the dataset from Kaggle website.
